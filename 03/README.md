# Day 03 - Shell (POSIX)

This solution relies on a posix shell (`sh`), along with various Unix utilities
(`grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, `cat`, `rm`, `expr`, `basename`, `dirname`, `head`).
In particular, it does not rely on any bash/zsh extensions, such as substrings,
arrays and so on.

Place your input in "input.txt", and running it (`sh solution.sh`) will print
the distance and relevant intersection for both parts of the solution. It takes
several seconds to run.
