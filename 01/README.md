# Day 01 - awk

This day's solution is an awk program. [Awk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK)
is a line-processing language, typically run by the `awk` command on Unix

Run it with any version of awk, passing your input on the standard input. For
instance, if your input is in "input.txt":

```shell
awk -f solution.awk < input.txt
```

It will print the solution to the first part, then the second part.
