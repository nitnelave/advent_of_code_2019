# Day 14 -- PHP

I did this day under the direction of a friend who was learning programming: we
walked through the problem together, with me asking what to do next, helping
him refine his ideas and then translating them to code. For this reason, I
chose a not-too-hard language, even though the problem is not too hard either
(I thought of writing it in a Makefile, but that would *not* have been
beginner-friendly :D ).

To run it, put your code in `input.txt` then run `php solution.php`.
